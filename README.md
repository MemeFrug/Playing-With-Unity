# Playing-With-Unity
A quick project i started in Unity

This repository will have the game files and all new updates to the game

If youll like to play the game i recommend going to my discord: (Discord Server Discontinued)

## License/Taking Files
If you would like to take any files or code please refer to the license (;
I woulda made the repository private if i dident want people taking stuff (;

P.S This is also my first repository so dont judge me

## Note
This repository is no longer maintained, or i have stopped this project for another, i tend to do this entill ive learnt enough to start on proper projects
