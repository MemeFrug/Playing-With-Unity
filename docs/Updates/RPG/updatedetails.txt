Today, I added some functionallity to the new ui elements from yesterday, such as reloading, you now have a ammo counter that actually displays the amount of ammo that
you have and also made a working inventory system so yeah.
<br><br>
Updates:
<br>
-You can now view the max ammo and the current ammount of ammo at the bottom left.
<br>
-There is now a working inventory, that you can view above the ammo counter
<br>
-You have the ability to reload by pressing 'r'
<br>
-You can switch between weponds by pressing 1, 2 and 3. If you dont have any weponds in those slots it wont select them. (Might Remove if want)
<br><br>
Known Bugs:
<br>
-When the client's restarts the amount of players connected to the room is wrong.
<br>
-The enemys movements is a bit not smooth when chasing.
<br>
-Sometimes you can randomly shoot yourself! While switching between weponds in your inventory.
<br><br>

Today, I removed the feature to hold down ctrl + mouse wheel to zoom in and out and also removed ctrl + "+" and ctrl + - but if u really wanted to zoom in and out
u still can open up the menu on the left and simply zoom in and out using the buttons and i added some loading animations. And i also fix a bug with last times. Aaaaand
I added some ui elements that do nothing right now such as an inventory veiwer and ammo counter.
bugfix.
<br><br>
Updates:
<br>
-There is new ui elements such as: inventory viewer, ammo counter.
<br>
-You can press 1 - 3 to toggle between inventorys
<br>
-U can no longer zoom in and out using methods like ctrl + "+" or ctrl + "-" or ctrl + mouse wheel
<br>
-In the login screen if you are disconnected from the server or are reconnecting you will now see a loading circle that is animated pog!
<br>
-Last time i fixed a bug where someone leaves and the server crashes, i fixed this bug last time but i found out it only fixed the crashing side of it... So now the 
players index gets properly updated when someone leaves so now you can properly damage one another including enemys!
<br>
-Fixed when you die by the enemy the enemy continues trying to kill you.
<br>
-When u die by an enemy you have 1.5 seconds of no damage time (it just resets your health and x, y pos to where u were teleported after u died)
<br>
-The enemy loses intress after an amount of time! (rn its 1000 seconds or milliseconds idk what it is but its a 1000 so yeah....)
